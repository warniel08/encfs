I used Python 3 for this project.

### Other important information about my solution
It can open and read files. It can also create and write to files.

#### In terminal one
Run the command:
```
$ python3 encfs.py test/ mountpoint
```

#### In terminal two
To read the contents of test/hello:
```
$ cat mountpoint/hello
```

To write an encrypted file to test/:
```
$ echo [some_string_input] > mountpoint/[file_name]
```
